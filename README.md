Proposal
--------

*Proposal for the Software Controlled Drone Project*

Prepared by Denis Stepanov and Kevin Libdan  
*Computer Engineering Technology Student*  
github.com/libs1/softwarecontrolleddrone.github.io

**Executive Summary**

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and actuators for controlling a drone. The database will store
information on flight control. The mobile device functionality will include
software support for controlling the flight of the drone and will be further
detailed in the mobile application proposal. I will be collaborating with the
following company/department Future Humber Quadcopter Swarm. In the winter
semester I plan to form a group with Kevin Libdan, who is also building similar
hardware this term and working on the mobile application with me. The hardware
will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production Techniques independently and
the application will be completed in CENG 319 Software Project. These will be
integrated together in the subsequent term in CENG 355 Computer Systems Project
as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

**Background**

The problem solved by project is to control a drone remotely with an application
built for android devices. The problem is to recognize the radio signal used to
communicate with the drone and make the android application to send proper
flight instructions to the drone.

Drone technology is fairly new and it’s becoming popular day by day. It has
become popular enough so that an organization like Amazon is testing product
delivery by drone. But controlling manual or automated flight path of drones is
difficult and requires dedicated controllers. Controllers can sometimes be more
expensive or non-intuitive to use. In this situation widely popular can make the
task more fun, intuitive and widely accessible. Android applications are easily
obtainable and can have very intuitive user interface. In addition android
devices are ubiquitous. So having proper android application for controlling the
drones has very high potential to make drones more popular and user friendly.

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content”[1] and have found and read [2] which provides insight into
similar efforts.

The first article discusses how UAVS have been getting a lot of attention due to
its low cost of implementation and how an AR drone is being controlled by a
motion capture system to follow a moving target. [@7786340]

The second article discusses how to collect input information for the controller
used for the AR drone. [@6852167]

The third article discusses estimating UAV systems total ownership cost
including hardware components, software design, and operations. [@6496852]

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java,

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

**Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project:  
Phase 1 Hardware build.  
Phase 2 System integration.  
Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

*Phase 1 Hardware build*

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

*Phase 2 System integration*

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

*Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers*

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

**Concluding remarks**

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for *Future Humber
Quadcopter Swarm*. This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and skills
developed in our program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project
demonstrating my ability to learn how to support projects such as the initiative
described by [3]. I request approval of this project.
